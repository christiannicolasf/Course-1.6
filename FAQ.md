        Bondage is born in the gap where wellbeing has been excluded. Where there is pain, beauty cannot thrive. You must take a stand against illusion. Only a being of the world may bring about this fusion of passion. Desire is the antithesis of complexity. You may be ruled by bondage without realizing it. Do not let it extinguish the healing of your vision quest. The future will be a magical unveiling of knowledge. We heal, we reflect, we are reborn. Conscious living is the knowledge of hope, and of us. Transcendence is a constant.

       After sitting through hours of New Age rhetoric, I decided to have a crack at writing code to generate it automatically and speed things up a bit. I cobbled together a list of New Age buzzwords and cliché sentence patterns and this is the result.
	You’ll get some profound-sounding nonsense here, too. So, what is this for? Put it on your website as placeholder text. Print it out as a speech for your yoga class and see if anyone can guess a computer wrote it. Use it to write the hottest new bestseller in the self-help section, or give false hope to depressed friends and family members.

        We exist as morphogenetic fields. To roam the quest is to become one with it. Empathy is the driver of coherence. You and I are lifeforms of the quantum matrix. This life is nothing short of an unfolding uprising of transformative empathy. Nothing is impossible. Rebirth requires exploration. Truth is a constant. The goal of supercharged waveforms is to plant the seeds of awareness rather than illusion.

        We can no longer afford to live with illusion. Where there is selfishness, health cannot thrive. Without awareness, one cannot exist. You must take a stand against ego. You may be ruled by bondage without realizing it. Do not let it sabotage the truth of your mission. Greed is the antithesis of flow. If you have never experienced this evolution undefined, it can be difficult to exist. How should you navigate this amazing biosphere? Although you may not realize it, you are holistic.

       Passion is the driver of awareness. You and I are dreamers of the cosmos. We live, we dream, we are reborn. The future will be a non-local blossoming of aspiration. The universe is approaching a tipping point. The oasis of freedom is now happening worldwide. We are at a crossroads of balance and selfishness. Throughout history, humans have been interacting with the totality via pulses. Our conversations with other dreamweavers have led to an unveiling of hyper-unrestricted consciousness.
